## What Are Synthetic Seeds?

### **Scientific Definition**
Synthetic seeds (also called artificial seeds) consist of somatic embryos or plant parts encapsulated in a protective covering that mimics natural seed functions. The encapsulated material can include:

- Somatic embryos
- Shoot buds
- Cell aggregates
- Meristematic tissues with regeneration potential

### **Historical Development**
- **1960s**: Murashige first introduced the artificial seed concept
- **1980s**: Kitto and Janick produced the first desiccated artificial carrot seeds
- **1984**: Redenbaugh et al. created true synthetic seeds using sodium alginate encapsulation with alfalfa somatic embryos

### **Key Components**
1. **Plant Material**: Viable embryos or meristematic tissue
2. **Protective Coating**: Usually sodium alginate-based encapsulation
3. **Nutritional Supplements**: Growth factors and beneficial microbes
4. **Storage Medium**: Specialized solutions for long-term viability

- BioCoupler system for germination
- 2× 8 oz glass jars
- 1× test tube for storage
- 2× micro-pipettes for precise handling
- 2× plastic cups for solution work
- 70% isopropyl alcohol for sterilization
- Medical gloves for safety

### **Step 1: Explant Preparation**
1. **Select Healthy Material**: Choose vigorous, disease-free plant tissue
2. **Surface Sterilization**: 
   - Immerse plant material in 10% bleach solution
   - Maintain contact for 10-15 minutes
   - Rinse thoroughly with sterile water
3. **Tissue Preparation**:
   - Cut nodes as small as possible (2-5mm optimal)
   - Work quickly to minimize oxidation
   - Keep tissue moist during preparation

### **Step 2: Initial Coating Process**
1. **Immersion in Solution A**:
   - Submerge plant nodes directly in Solution A
   - Ensure complete coating of all tissue surfaces
   - Allow 2-3 minutes for thorough penetration
2. **Tissue Handling**:
   - Use sterile micro-pipettes for all transfers
   - Avoid crushing or damaging delicate tissues
   - Work within sterile environment (still air box recommended)

### **Step 3: Encapsulation Process**
1. **Tissue Transfer**:
   - Using micro-pipettes, carefully aspirate coated tissue with small amount of Solution A
   - Maintain gentle suction to avoid tissue damage
2. **Hardening in Solution B**:
   - Release coated tissue into Solution B
   - This step polymerizes the outer coating layer
   - Forms the protective synthetic seed shell

### **Step 4: Stabilization**
1. **Timing Control**:
   - Maintain immersion in Solution B for minimum 5 minutes
   - Do not exceed 10 minutes (over-hardening can prevent germination)
2. **Quality Check**:
   - Verify uniform coating formation
   - Check for air bubbles or coating defects
   - Remove any damaged or poorly formed seeds

### **Step 5: Collection and Storage**
1. **Careful Removal**:
   - Use sterile tools to remove stabilized synthetic seeds from Solution B
   - Drain excess solution without damaging coating
2. **Storage Transfer**:
   - Move synthetic seeds to sterile 15ml tubes
   - Add appropriate storage medium if required
3. **Long-term Storage**:
   - Store in refrigerator at 4°C
   - Maintain storage for up to one year
   - Label with date and plant variety
