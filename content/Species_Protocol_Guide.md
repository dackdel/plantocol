## African Violet (Saintpaulia ionantha) ⭐
### **Why Start with African Violets?**
African violets are the gold standard for beginner tissue culture. They respond excellently to standard protocols, have high success rates, and provide clear visual feedback on technique quality.

### **Materials Needed**
- Healthy, non-flowering African violet plant
- 70% ethanol
- 15% bleach solution (0.75% sodium hypochlorite)
- Surfactant (1-2 drops liquid soap per 100ml bleach solution)
- MS medium with hormones
- Sterile distilled water
- Sterile tools (forceps, scalpel)

### **Step-by-Step Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Explant Selection and Preparation**
1. **Choose Optimal Explants**:
   - Select healthy, mature leaves with petioles attached
   - Avoid flowering plants (reduces success rates)
   - Use leaves from disease-free, vigorous plants
   - Morning harvest provides best results

2. **Initial Cleaning**:
   - Rinse explants under running tap water
   - Remove any visible debris or damaged tissue
   - Pat gently dry with paper towels

#### **Step 2: Surface Sterilization**
1. **Alcohol Pre-treatment** (30 seconds):
   - Immerse explants in 70% ethanol
   - Agitate gently to ensure complete coverage
   - This breaks surface tension for better bleach penetration

2. **Primary Sterilization** (15 minutes):
   - Transfer to 15% bleach solution with surfactant
   - Ensure complete submersion
   - Agitate every 5 minutes for uniform treatment

3. **Sterile Rinses** (3× minimum):
   - First rinse: 5 minutes in sterile distilled water
   - Second rinse: 5 minutes in fresh sterile water
   - Third rinse: 10 minutes in fresh sterile water
   - Additional rinses if bleach odor persists

#### **Step 3: Culture Initiation**
1. **Explant Preparation**:
   - Work within sterile environment (SAB or laminar flow)
   - Cut petiole to 2-3 cm length using sterile scalpel
   - Make fresh cuts on leaf base to expose meristematic tissue

2. **Media Placement**:
   - **Initiation Medium Formula**:
     - MS basal medium
     - 30 g/L sucrose
     - 1.0 mg/L BAP (cytokinin)
     - 0.1 mg/L IAA (auxin)
     - 8 g/L agar
     - pH 5.6-5.8

3. **Culture Conditions**:
   - Temperature: 22-25°C (72-77°F)
   - Light: 16h photoperiod, moderate intensity
   - Humidity: Sealed culture vessels maintain high humidity

#### **Step 4: Multiplication Phase** (4-6 weeks)
1. **Growth Monitoring**:
   - Shoots typically appear after 2-3 weeks
   - Multiple shoots develop from petiole base
   - Healthy shoots show bright green coloration

2. **Subculturing Process**:
   - Transfer to fresh multiplication medium every 4-6 weeks
   - Carefully separate individual shoots
   - Each shoot can be cultured as independent explant

#### **Step 5: Rooting** (2-4 weeks)
**Natural Rooting**: African violets often develop roots spontaneously on multiplication medium. If rooting occurs, proceed directly to acclimatization.

**Dedicated Rooting**: If roots don't develop:
1. **Rooting Medium**:
   - Half-strength MS medium
   - 20 g/L sucrose
   - Hormone-free or very low hormone concentration
   - 8 g/L agar

#### **Step 6: Acclimatization** (2-3 weeks)
1. **Root Cleaning**:
   - Gently remove all agar from roots under running water
   - Avoid damaging delicate root hairs

2. **Transplanting**:
   - Use sterile potting mix (peat/perlite/vermiculite)
   - Small pots (2-3 inches) for initial transplant
   - Plant at same depth as in culture

3. **Humidity Management**:
   - Cover with clear plastic bag or container
   - Maintain high humidity initially (90-95%)
   - Gradually increase ventilation over 2-3 weeks

### **Success Indicators**
- **Week 1-2**: No contamination, explants remain green
- **Week 3-4**: Shoot primordia visible at petiole base
- **Week 5-8**: Multiple shoots developing
- **Week 9-12**: Rooted plantlets ready for acclimatization

### **Troubleshooting African Violets**
- **No Shoot Formation**: Increase BAP to 1.5-2.0 mg/L
- **Excessive Callus**: Reduce IAA or increase BAP concentration
- **Poor Rooting**: Try IBA at 0.5-1.0 mg/L in rooting medium
- **Acclimatization Loss**: Maintain higher humidity longer

## Hosta (Hosta species) ⭐⭐
### **Why Hosta for Intermediate Practice?**
Hostas maintain their distinctive variegation patterns through tissue culture, making them valuable for ornamental production. They require slightly more precision than African violets but still offer good success rates.

### **Materials and Setup**
- Dormant or early-growth Hosta plants
- Standard sterilization materials
- MS medium with modified hormone concentrations
- Cool growing conditions (important for Hostas)

### **Step-by-Step Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Explant Selection**
1. **Optimal Timing**:
   - Early spring when shoots are 1-2 cm tall
   - Dormant crown tissue works well
   - Avoid summer collection (higher phenolic content)

2. **Explant Types**:
   - **Primary**: Central crown tissue (1-2 cm sections)
   - **Alternative**: Young leaf bases with meristematic tissue
   - **Size**: Keep explants small to ensure sterilization penetration

#### **Step 2: Enhanced Sterilization** (Hostas can carry endophytes)
1. **Pre-treatment**:
   - Remove outer leaves and debris
   - Cut away any damaged or discolored tissue
   - Rinse thoroughly under running water

2. **Sterilization Sequence**:
   - 70% ethanol: 15 seconds (shorter than African violet)
   - 15% bleach + surfactant: 20 minutes (longer than African violet)
   - Sterile water rinses: 3× 5 minutes each

#### **Step 3: Culture Initiation**
1. **Initiation Medium**:
   - MS basal medium
   - 30 g/L sucrose
   - 2.0 mg/L BAP (higher than African violet)
   - 0.1 mg/L NAA (more stable than IAA)
   - 8 g/L agar
   - pH 5.7

2. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Temperature: 20-22°C (cooler than African violet)
   - Light: Moderate intensity, 16h photoperiod
   - Monitor for browning (common in Hostas)

#### **Step 4: Multiplication Management**
1. **Subculture Schedule**:
   - Every 4-5 weeks (slightly longer than African violet)
   - Watch for vigor decline in later subcultures
   - Fresh explants every 6-8 subcultures

2. **Multiplication Medium Adjustment**:
   - Maintain BAP at 2.0 mg/L for strong multiplication
   - Consider reducing to 1.5 mg/L if excessive callus forms
   - NAA can be reduced to 0.05 mg/L in later subcultures

#### **Step 5: Rooting Protocol**
1. **Rooting Medium**:
   - Full-strength MS medium
   - 20 g/L sucrose
   - 1.0 mg/L IBA (essential for Hosta rooting)
   - No cytokinin
   - 8 g/L agar

2. **Rooting Conditions**:
   - Maintain cool temperatures (20-22°C)
   - Reduce light intensity during rooting
   - Expect 2-4 weeks for root development

#### **Step 6: Acclimatization**
1. **Special Considerations**:
   - Hostas prefer gradual temperature adjustment
   - Use well-draining, organic potting mix
   - Maintain cool, humid conditions initially

2. **Gradual Hardening**:
   - Week 1: Full humidity, shade
   - Week 2: Partial ventilation, filtered light
   - Week 3: Normal conditions, monitor for stress

### **Success Metrics for Hosta**
- **Multiplication Rate**: 3-5 shoots per explant every 4-5 weeks
- **Rooting Success**: 80-90% of shoots develop adequate roots
- **Variegation Maintenance**: Patterns remain stable through culture
- **Acclimatization**: 85-95% survival with proper hardening

### **Troubleshooting Hosta Culture**
- **Browning**: Add activated charcoal (1 g/L) to medium
- **Poor Multiplication**: Increase BAP to 2.5 mg/L
- **Rooting Failure**: Try pulse treatment (5 mg/L IBA for 48 hours)
- **Variegation Loss**: Usually temporary, returns during acclimatization
