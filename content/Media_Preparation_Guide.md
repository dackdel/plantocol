## Understanding Media Types: The Foundation of Success

### **What Is Culture Media?**
Culture media serves as a complete life-support system for plant tissues growing in vitro. It provides all the nutrients, energy sources, and chemical signals needed for healthy development in a controlled, sterile environment.

### **Key Differences: Multiplication vs. Rooting Media**

#### **Multiplication Media Purpose**
- **Primary Goal**: Induce shoot formation and increase plantlet numbers
- **Hormonal Focus**: High cytokinin-to-auxin ratio promotes cell division and shoot development
- **Growth Pattern**: Encourages multiple shoot formation from single explants
- **Timeline**: Typically used for 4-6 weeks per subculture cycle

#### **Rooting Media Purpose**  
- **Primary Goal**: Support root formation in developed shoots
- **Hormonal Focus**: High auxin-to-cytokinin ratio stimulates root initiation
- **Growth Pattern**: Promotes strong root system development
- **Timeline**: Usually 2-4 weeks for adequate root establishment
