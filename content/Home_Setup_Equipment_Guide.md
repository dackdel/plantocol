5. Allow surfaces to dry completely before beginning work

### 2. Sterilization Equipment

**Professional Option**: Autoclave ($2,000-$15,000)
- Uses high-pressure steam for complete sterilization

**Home Alternative**: Digital Pressure Cooker ($50-$150)
- Maintains 121°C temperature under pressure
- Effectively sterilizes glassware and media

**Sterilization Protocol**:
1. Fill pressure cooker with appropriate water level
2. Place items in sterilization containers
3. Set to high pressure (15 psi minimum)
4. Maintain 121°C for 20 minutes minimum
5. Allow natural pressure release before opening

### 3. Tool Sterilization

**Professional Option**: Dry heat sterilizer ($500-$2,000)

**Home Alternative**: Butane Torch ($15-$30)
- Instant sterilization of metal tools
- Heat tools to red-hot temperature
- Allow cooling in sterile environment before use

### 4. Media Preparation Equipment

**Essential Items**:
- **Digital Scale**: 0.01g precision minimum ($30-$80)
- **Glass Beakers**: Heat-resistant borosilicate ($20-$50 set)
- **pH Meter or Strips**: 5.6-5.8 range critical ($25-$100)
- **Magnetic Stirrer**: For consistent mixing ($50-$150)
- **Measuring Cylinders**: Various sizes for accuracy ($30-$60)

### 5. Growth Environment

**Lighting System**:
- **LED Grow Lights**: Full spectrum panels ($50-$200)
- **Timer**: Automated 16h light/8h dark cycle ($15-$30)
- **Light Intensity**: 30-50 μmol m⁻²s⁻¹ (moderate intensity)

**Temperature Control**:
- Maintain 22-25°C (72-77°F) consistently
- Use room heater/AC or heated growing chamber
- Monitor with digital thermometer ($10-$25)
